# AIoT-Based Alcohol-Based Mental Fitness Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting mental fitness using an AIoT-based system by combining physiological sensor data and machine learning. The system performs real-time prediction using sensor inputs and displays results through a web interface.

This project was developed during my AIoT internship at NIT Warangal.
